        "answer" => "I don't like to give a set number because honestly, what if we want to do more? I will tell the full story of every segment of our time together and include absolutely everyone who was there. I'm going to edit the best of the day, and if you want my unedited, you're welcome to the outtakes."

        "answer" => "I'm very compassionate and patient with every single person who comes to your event. We've had plenty of cool kids with autism or other special needs at weddings. I grew up with a special needs relative and I'm very sensitive to making sure all guests are comfortable with my photography. If you have folks who can't walk far and you need me to bring extra folding chairs for them, just let me know. We can also make sure to plan level ground for any guests in wheelchairs. Just let me know during the early planning phases. I'll make sure your day runs smoothly for everyone."

        "question" => "04. Are pets welcomed at weddings?",
        "answer" => "Please bring your pets to weddings. They lower my stress. All kidding aside, volunteering with several animal rescues is a big part of my life and I welcome all pets to weddings. We've had cats and dogs, horses and donkeys so far."

    array(
        "question" => "05. Do you have any of those cute wedding props and signs?",
        "answer" => "I've always got a few cute signs and props packed into my camera bag. If there's something specific you'd like, just let me know, and I'll see what I have for you to play with. As a bonus, wedding props are a great way to get fussy kids to focus."

        "question" => "06. Do you have a wedding arch we can use?",
