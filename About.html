                    I'm Ela Doe</h1>
                <p style="overflow: none;">
                    Well hello there! My name is Ela and I'm an adventurous wedding/elopement photographer who lives
                    in Prishtina. I have a love for people who think outside the box and are not afraid to be
                    themselves, and I love being able to capture that on camera. I have a Bachelor's degree in
                    CSE from the University
                    of Bussines and Technology and I'm always listening to a true crime podcast.

                    <br><br>
                    Here are a few things about me!
                    <br><br>
                    The girl who eats stupid amounts of chocolate every day - dark chocolate with sea salt all the way

                    <br>
                    The girl who can’t stand to be late, if she’s not early, she’s already late
                    <br>

                Traveling is honestly one of my passions. I make it a point to get out and explore this
                beautiful earth
                as often as humanly possible. I am on the move pretty often, so if you happen to be in the
                same place as
                me or if your schedule lines up with my travel dates, we can make your photos happen with no

                <p>I understand that your day is not just about capturing beautiful images, but also ensuring that
                    everything runs smoothly. While I cannot take the place of a wedding planner (worth their weight in
                    gold), I am here to support you in any way I can.</p>
                <p>From helping you create the perfect photography timeline to offering suggestions for the best
                    locations and lighting for your portraits, I am here to make sure that you have the best possible
                    experience on your wedding day.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>On your wedding day, my goal is to capture every moment - from the big, emotional moments to the
                    small, candid ones. I want you to relax and enjoy your special day, knowing that every moment is
                    being documented.</p>
                <p>My approach is to capture the natural beauty of your day, without forcing any awkward or
                    uncomfortable poses. So let's have fun, relax, and create beautiful memories together</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>I understand how excited you are to see your wedding photos, so I won't make you wait long. Within 48
                    hours of your special day, I will send you a curated preview of some of the highlights from your
                    wedding.
                </p>
                <p>This way, you can relive the memories while you wait for the full gallery to be completed. Your full
                    gallery will become ready for you within 8-10 weeks after your wedding day.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>I believe that your wedding day memories should last a lifetime, which is why I provide you with a

                    will give you easy access to all your wedding day memories, so you can print, download, and share
                    them with your loved ones.</p>

                    <div class="question">01. When will we get our images?</div>
                    <div class="answer">Most galleries are delivered in three weeks, unless it's a very busy time of the
                        year. However, if you have a specific reason that you must have them earlier, we can work with
                        you.</div>

                        I will tell the full story of every segment of our time together and include absolutely everyone
                        who was there. I'm going to edit the best of the day, and if you want my unedited, you're
                        welcome to the outtakes.</div>

                    <div class="answer">I'm very compassionate and patient with every single person who comes to your
                        event. We've had plenty of cool kids with autism or other special needs at weddings. I grew up
                        with a special needs relative and I'm very sensitive to making sure all guests are comfortable
                        with my photography. If you have folks who can't walk far and you need me to bring extra folding
                        chairs for them, just let me know. We can also make sure to plan level ground for any guests in
                        wheelchairs. Just let me know during the early planning phases. I'll make sure your day runs
                        smoothly for everyone.</div>

                        volunteering with several animal rescues is a big part of my life and I welcome all pets to
                        weddings. We've had cats and dogs, horses and donkeys so far.</div>

                    <div class="answer">I've always got a few cute signs and props packed into my camera bag. If there's
                        something specific you'd like, just let me know, and I'll see what I have for you to play with.
                        As a bonus, wedding props are a great way to get fussy kids to focus.</div>

                        for a small nominal fee, and I'll bring it and set it up for you. Wedding arches aren't allowed
                        at every location, so check in with me.</div>
