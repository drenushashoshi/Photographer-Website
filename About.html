                    I'm Ela Doe</h1>
                <p style="overflow: none;">
                    Well hello there! My name is Ela and I'm an adventurous wedding/elopement photographer who lives
                    in Prishtina. I have a love for people who think outside the box and are not afraid to be
                    themselves, and I love being able to capture that on camera. I have a Bachelor's degree in
                    CSE from the University
                    of Bussines and Technology and I'm always listening to a true crime podcast.

                    <br><br>

                Traveling is honestly one of my passions. I make it a point to get out and explore this
                beautiful earth
                as often as humanly possible. I am on the move pretty often, so if you happen to be in the
                same place as
                me or if your schedule lines up with my travel dates, we can make your photos happen with no
                travel
                fees! Check out my schedule at the link below!
