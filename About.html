                    I'm Ela Doe</h1>
                <p style="overflow: none;">
                    Well hello there! My name is Ela and I'm an adventurous wedding/elopement photographer who lives
                    in Prishtina. I have a love for people who think outside the box and are not afraid to be
                    themselves, and I love being able to capture that on camera. I have a Bachelor's degree in
                    CSE from the University
                    of Bussines and Technology and I'm always listening to a true crime podcast.

                    <br><br>
                    Here are a few things about me!
                    <br><br>

                Traveling is honestly one of my passions. I make it a point to get out and explore this
                beautiful earth
                as often as humanly possible. I am on the move pretty often, so if you happen to be in the
                same place as
                me or if your schedule lines up with my travel dates, we can make your photos happen with no
                travel
                fees! Check out my schedule at the link below!

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="question">01. When will we get our images?</div>
                    <div class="answer">Most galleries are delivered in three weeks, unless it's a very busy time of the
                        year. However, if you have a specific reason that you must have them earlier, we can work with
                        you.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="question">02. How many images will be in our finished viewing gallery?</div>
                    <div class="answer">I don't like to give a set number because honestly, what if we want to do more?
                        I will tell the full story of every segment of our time together and include absolutely everyone
                        who was there. I'm going to edit the best of the day, and if you want my unedited, you're
                        welcome to the outtakes.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="question">03. What if we have somebody with special needs or mobility issues?</div>
                    <div class="answer">I'm very compassionate and patient with every single person who comes to your
                        event. We've had plenty of cool kids with autism or other special needs at weddings. I grew up
                        with a special needs relative and I'm very sensitive to making sure all guests are comfortable
                        with my photography. If you have folks who can't walk far and you need me to bring extra folding
                        chairs for them, just let me know. We can also make sure to plan level ground for any guests in
                        wheelchairs. Just let me know during the early planning phases. I'll make sure your day runs
                        smoothly for everyone.</div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="question">04. Are pets welcomed at weddings?</div>
                    <div class="answer">Please bring your pets to weddings. They lower my stress. All kidding aside,
                        volunteering with several animal rescues is a big part of my life and I welcome all pets to
                        weddings. We've had cats and dogs, horses and donkeys so far.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="question">05. Do you have any of those cute wedding props and signs?</div>
                    <div class="answer">I've always got a few cute signs and props packed into my camera bag. If there's
                        something specific you'd like, just let me know, and I'll see what I have for you to play with.
                        As a bonus, wedding props are a great way to get fussy kids to focus.</div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="question">06. Do you have a wedding arch we can use?</div>
                    <div class="answer">I do have several weddings arches and multiple faux flower displays. I rent this
                        for a small nominal fee, and I'll bring it and set it up for you. Wedding arches aren't allowed
                        at every location, so check in with me.</div>
