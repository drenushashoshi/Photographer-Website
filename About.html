                <p style="overflow: none;">
                    Well hello there! My name is Ela and I'm an adventurous wedding/elopement photographer who lives
                    in Prishtina. I have a love for people who think outside the box and are not afraid to be
                    themselves, and I love being able to capture that on camera. I have a Bachelor's degree in
                    CSE from the University
                    of Bussines and Technology and I'm always listening to a true crime podcast.
