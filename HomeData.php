        ['Hayley + Kit','Where do I start? Ela is the absolute best and we felt like we scored big time 
        having her with us on our wedding day. Her photos speak for themselves 
        but the woman behind the camera is equally as amazing. 
        She was gracious with our guests (parents) that felt like they needed their own iphone pictures, 
        always responsive, was everywhere on our wedding day (without us even noticing half of the time), 
        was responsive and helpful in the planning process, 
        and honestly just someone my','Home_Pictures/WhatClientsHaveToSay4.jpg'],
        ['Brock + Wajiha', 'There aren’t enough positive things to say about Sarah. She photographed two days of
        my south Asian wedding and she captured the joy so beautifully! 
        I know how nerve-racking it can be to make a final decision on a photographer, 
        but look no further. Sarah engenders trust like no other. 
        She has a quiet and calming presence, which is so helpful to have on your wedding day!
        My husband and I are not comfortable in front of the camera, 
        but Sarah made us look like naturals. 
        I received so many compliments on my photos. 
        Of all the vendor decisions I made during the course of wedding planning, 
        deciding on a Sarah E. Photography was the best one I made!','Home_Pictures/WhatClientsHaveToSay2.png'],
        ['Leo + JoAnn','Ela is the BEST photographer we have ever encountered! 
        I cant tell you enough how many times we have seen the pictures over and over 
        and the many compliments we have received over the pictures. 
        Seriously best money we have EVER spent! Ela called us about two weeks before 
        the wedding to make a timeline and the day of the wedding, 
        she made sure everything we had planned came out a reality. 
        Our family loved her! We are so THANKFUL!! This is an understatement of just how 
        awesome she is and how amazing her talent is! Seriously, everyone NEEDS to hire her asap!
