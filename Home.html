                                We had planned to go up to the rooftop of the hotel to capture their first look and wedding party 
                                photos and stumbled upon a 300 person swingers party and an incoming rain storm.

                            <p>
                                In the foothills of Denver, Colorado, at a flower farm, 
                                Seth and Jordan celebrated their love with all of their friends and family. 
                                Lyons Farmette provided the perfect backdrop for a beautiful summer day in Colorado. 
                                The sun shone brightly all day, covering the farm in the warmest light. 
                                Flowers, just starting to bloom, and lush grass covered the farm. 
                                Perfect for Jordan's barefoot wedding dreams.

                        <p>Where do I start? Ela is the absolute best and we felt like we scored big time 
                            having her with us on our wedding day. Her photos speak for themselves 
                            but the woman behind the camera is equally as amazing. 
                            She was gracious with our guests (parents) that felt like they needed their own iphone pictures, 
                            always responsive, was everywhere on our wedding day (without us even noticing half of the time), 
                            was responsive and helpful in the planning process, 
                            and honestly just someone my husband and I would want to be friends with in real life. 
                            We are so grateful for Ela!
