                        <p>
                            In the foothills of Denver, Colorado, at a flower farm, 
                            Seth and Jordan celebrated their love with all of their friends and family. 
                            Lyons Farmette provided the perfect backdrop for a beautiful summer day in Colorado. 
                            The sun shone brightly all day, covering the farm in the warmest light. 
                            Flowers, just starting to bloom, and lush grass covered the farm. 
                            Perfect for Jordan's barefoot wedding dreams.

            <h1><b>WHY ELA?</b></h1><br><br>
            <h3><b>Experience</b></h3><br>
            <p>I have shot over 100 weddings and have photographed in a wide variety of venues, 
                lighting situations, and family dynamics. You can expect professionalism. 
                Offering guidance, reassurance and a calming presence throughout your wedding day. 
            </p><br>
            <h3><b>Direct Communication</b></h3><br>
            <p>Quick and clear communication throughout the booking and planning process. 
                And over communication on your wedding day to ensure you, your family and guests are informed.  
                You will be in direct contact with me throughout the entire process, 
                no jumping through hoops to get in touch or being deferred to an assistant.
            </p><br>
            <h3><b>Planning Assistance</b></h3><br>
            <p>
                A free wedding guide is given to all couples to help with the planning process. 
                I provide timeline assistance to all couples, even if you have a planner/coordinator. 
                I am never more than a phone call or text away.

                <p>I’m here to tell your story. Not just take pretty pictures - although I will do that too. 
                    I want to tell the truth through photographs. 
                    To share the reality - that your wedding day is the one day all of your closest friends 
                    and family are in one place at the same time. All there to celebrate and witness your 
                    beautiful union. No matter what that looks like I’m here to tell that story.

                <p>
                    Better known as the one crying on your wedding day. 
                    You’ll find me tearing up at some point, something about watching other people’s love just 
                    gets to me. You’ll also probably find me balancing a camera in one hand, 
                    bouquet in the other and a veil around my neck.

                    <p>Where do I start? Ela is the absolute best and we felt like we scored big time 
                        having her with us on our wedding day. Her photos speak for themselves 
                        but the woman behind the camera is equally as amazing. 
                        She was gracious with our guests (parents) that felt like they needed their own iphone pictures, 
                        always responsive, was everywhere on our wedding day (without us even noticing half of the time), 
                        was responsive and helpful in the planning process, 
                        and honestly just someone my husband and I would want to be friends with in real life. 
                        We are so grateful for Ela!

                    <p>There aren’t enough positive things to say about Sarah. She photographed two days of
                        my south Asian wedding and she captured the joy so beautifully! 
                        I know how nerve-racking it can be to make a final decision on a photographer, 
                        but look no further. Sarah engenders trust like no other. 
                        She has a quiet and calming presence, which is so helpful to have on your wedding day!
                        My husband and I are not comfortable in front of the camera, 
                        but Sarah made us look like naturals. 
                        I received so many compliments on my photos. 
                        Of all the vendor decisions I made during the course of wedding planning, 
                        deciding on a Sarah E. Photography was the best one I made!

                    <p>Ela is the BEST photographer we have ever encountered! 
                        I can't tell you enough how many times we have seen the pictures over and over 
                        and the many compliments we have received over the pictures. 
                        Seriously best money we have EVER spent! Ela called us about two weeks before 
                        the wedding to make a timeline and the day of the wedding, 
                        she made sure everything we had planned came out a reality. 
                        Our family loved her! We are so THANKFUL!! This is an understatement of just how 
                        awesome she is and how amazing her talent is! Seriously, everyone NEEDS to hire her asap! 
                        Like now, Do it!
