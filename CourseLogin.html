                <h3>WHAT EQUIPMENT TO I NEED?</h3>
                <p>You will need a camera that has manual settings and a standard kit lens. 
                    This is generally a DSLR or mirrorless camera, but some bridge cameras are also fine. 
                    An easy way to tell if your camera is suitable is to look at the top of it and see if it has a 
                    dial with the letter M (for manual) on it. You will also need a tripod.
